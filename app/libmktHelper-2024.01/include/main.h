/// OVERVIEW ---------------------------
///
/// kmarketSpeed returns its results by 'stdout'.
/// Warnings are returned by the field "Errors" inside the normal response.
/// Exceptions are returned by 'stderr'.
///
/// CONSTANTS --------------------------
///
/// Returns constants used by 'kmarketSpeed'.
/// Input:
///   - command (s): "constants"
/// Output:
///   - historicQuotes (i): Number of expected quotes in 'NICK'.tb files.
///   - initialCapital (f): Simulation initial capital.
///   - minToBet (f): Minimum cash to can bet.
///   - bet (f): Bet amount.
///   - daysLoss (f): Quarantine days (5 days per week -> 9 weeks).
///   - noLossMultiplicator: Quarantine limit
///                          ('sell >= buy * no_loss_multiplicator' is ok).
///   - withdrawalLimit (f): Limit to withdrawal cash (initialCapital + bet + bet).
///   - orderBuy (i): Order type 'buy'.
///   - orderSell (i): Order type 'sell'.
///
/// READING QUOTES ---------------------
///
/// Returns the quotes requested normalized (removing -1).
/// Input:
///   - command (s)     : "readQuotes"
///   - path (s)        : Directory of quotes.
///   - nquotes (i)     : 2 -> read open and closes.
///                       4 -> read open, close, maxs and mins.
///   - Cos ([s.])      : Companies to read quotes.
/// Output:
///   - Dates ([s.])    : Dates of quotes.

///   - Errors ([s.])   : Detected errors.
/// 'Cos' requested and returnd can not match. In such case one o more error
/// messages are registered in 'Errors'.
///
